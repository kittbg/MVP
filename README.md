# MVP:  Minimum Viable Product  
The purpose of the MVP project is to develop a fullstack application with full CRUD functionality.
This project presents a basic autombile inventory management system for a single dealership.  The frontend has a graphic representation of the current inventory and displays basic details of each vehicle.  The interactive sections of the page provide Read, Create, Update and Delete functions to modifiy the inventory.  Current capabilities include: a search filter, the ability to add a single entity to the DB, the ability to modify a single entity, and to delete an entity.  The DB can be expanded to encompass far more vehicle details, i.e. VIN numbers, etc.. A version of this page can be developed and presented as a publicly accessible page with only search and shop features.
